I am a Professor in the Department of Statistics & Data Science at UCLA. 

Prior to joining UCLA in 2022, I was a Professor of Statistics and Computer Science at the University of Florida. I also served as the the Founding Director of the Informatics Institute at the University of Florida. Before that I spent 17 years as a faculty member in Statistics and EECS at the University of Michigan.

My research focuses on methodological and theoretical work in high-dimensional statistics, optimization, machine learning and neural networks, change point analysis, and network modeling. I am also interested in applications of statistical methods to engineering, biomedicine and economic/finance problems.
